### Features
* Monthly pie charts
* Filter expenses by year

* The bar for each month is color-coded to indicate spending level relative to fixed monthly allowance of $5,000. The color scale ranges from green for spending below 50% of allowance, to yellow for spending between 50% and 75%, and finally to red for spending exceeding 75% of allowance

### What am I working on right now?
I am currently following a Udemy course to learn how to use React routers and implement them in my app, specifically for creating a login/signup page. Once users successfully log in, they will be directed to their individual app homepage.
